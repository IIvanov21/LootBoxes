## Introduction 
### Objective
The idea is to develop an application with service oriented architecture. The requirements state there should be at least 4 services.
  * Service 1(Front-End): The core service which will render the application and create the communication between the other 3 back-end services.
  * Service 2&3(Back-End): These will both generate a random "Object" each based on personal choice as a developer.
  * Service 4(Back-End): This will create an object that is based on the objects created from service 2 and 3 using pre-defined rules.
 The project needs to utilise these technologies:
  * Kanban Board: Asana or an equivalent Kanban Board
  * Version Control: Git
  * CI Server: Jenkins
  * Configuration Management: Ansible
  * Cloud server: GCP virtual machines
  * Containerisation: Docker
  * Orchestration Tool: Docker Swarm
  * Reverse Proxy: NGINX
 The final delivery of the project is a completed CI Pipeline with full documentation around the utilisation of supporting tools. The CI Pipeline needs to be able to successfully deploy the application you have created.
 ### Proposal
 The importance of the project is the CI Pipeline being able to implement and utilise each section as mentioned above with the constraints. Therefore the application itself is   fairly simple in comparison. The idea is to generate a Weapon LootBox and it will drop a weapon with a skin.
 
 #### Weapon LootBox Generator
 * Service 1(Front-End): will display the contents of the loot drop generated by the 3 services. This service will also include limited history of previous loots drops.
 * Service 2(Back-End): Returns a random weapon from a list.  
 * Service 3(Back-End): Returns a random skin for the weapon including stats for the skins such as condition, rarity and name.
 * Service 4(Back-End): Returns a Weapon combined with a skin and stats for rarity based on the skin condition, name and rarirty. 
 
## Architecture
### Risk Assessment
Risk Assement table analyses the possible risks I could encounter during the development and management of the project.

All the highlighted rows were added later on during the development process after they became clear. The yellow risks are potential threat depending on how the development of the project is handled.
### Trello Board
The progress of the project is documented using Trello as it is well suited for a small scale project. The initials setup of the board looks as follows:

## Inftrastructure
### Entity Diagram
The project utilises a single Entity Relationship Diagram with only one table. The table essentially describes the delivered information to the end user. Also describing the elements in the table will allow me as a developer to confirm the type of validation I need to take in account when implementing a feature and performing testing.
